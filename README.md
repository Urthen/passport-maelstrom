passport-maelstrom
==================

Maelstrom Network addon for [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org). You may view a live example of this npm module in action at [http://nodetest.projectmaelstrom.com](http://nodetest.projectmaelstrom.com). The network operates with oAuth2; this module is founded on jaredhanson's [passport-facebook](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-facebook) which operates under a similar strategy.

For more implementation details, please see comments in the example implementation provided as part of this package or see further information in the [code for the live test](https://github.com/Urthen/MaelstromNodeTestApp).
